<h1>Location</h1>
<p>We are located adjacent to the Taconic State Park where New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts meet in the Southern Berkshire Range.</p>
<p>Mt. Brace remains such a popular flying destination because of the range's smooth geography and high altitude which allow for pleasant soaring in SW to NW directions. The farming valley below and the immense scale of the range help generate large, cohesive thermals. Nearby are several other sites that are being developed for N and ESE launching.</p>
<p>We have services for certified paragliding instruction, towing, showers, tiki bar, sun deck, heated jacuzzi and more amenities for visitors.</p>
<p>Swimming and rock climbing are available in the surrounding State Parks. Nearby lakeside towns feature boating, fishing and white water raft/canoe tour operations. Also, the attractive countryside is perfect for hiking and biking. Lime Rock is home to the famous NASCAR Raceway. In the nearby villages of Great Barrington, Millerton, Copake, Lakeville and Salisbury visitors will discover cosey bed and breakfasts, fine country inns and superb dinning.</p>
<p>Tanglewood, renowned for its world class concerts, as well as other enjoyable attractions, are within easy reach from the Mt. Brace Flight Park.</p>
<p>Again, we welcome everyone to join us for another awesome season of fun flying and learning, and for the opportunity to share our very special community.</p>
