Flight Park Rules/Guidlines

All Pilots P2,P3 and P4 and HG flying Brace are required to have an Approved Brace Pilot Helmet Sticker available from Club Officers in LZ  when you come to sign in Pilot book before going up to Launch.

Obey the State Park Rules and the Mt Brace Outdoor Club Rules (click here)
To practice in the Mt Brace Flight Park LZ you must be a current member of USHPA and pay the Mt Brace Flight Park fees with waivers signed. To leave the ground on the training hills you must have a P1 rating or be under instructor supervision.
All Paragliding and Hang Gliding Pilots and are welcome to fly and play at the Mt. Brace Flight Park.
By respecting the need for these important guidelines, and taking responsibility for one's own actions, a safer and more organized experience will be shared by all. We sincerely hope everyone enjoys our Flight Park facilities as well as the N.Y. Taconic State Park and the surrounding Berkshire Hills.
Please be advised that each visiting person, pilot or non-pilot is required to sign a Flight Park Waiver and pay the respective Flight Park Fees. to use and enjoy all of the Flight Park facilities:LZ, parking,bathrooms, hot tub, volley ball, showers,barbecue,Tiki bar, sun deck etc. Fill out the forms on both sides, sign them, place them in the envelopes provided and drop them in the waiver/Fee box in the LZ with the appropriate fees.
Pilots going to launch to fly must sign the pilot log book in the LZ. Check to see if any other pilot has indicated that the Park Ranger has been notified of pilots flying Brace Mountain on that day. If no one has called the Park Ranger then it is the responsibility of the first pilot or group of pilots to make that call. It's simple. Call (518) 329-3993 and say, "I'm calling from the Brace Club. I just wanted to let you know we will be flying today" - it's required by the Park officials.
We ask that pilots be responsible for their friends and family. Please oversee the proper signing of the waivers and the paying of the Flight Park Fees. Please park your vehicles in the designated areas.
If you are going to launch to watch the pilots, please follow these simple, but practical, instructions:

Please program the phone numbers of your friends and family, the LZ and the Park Police into your cell phone
Each group of hikers should have a radio set to the proper frequency to communicate if need be. (Talk with your flying friends about extra radios that can be used)
Before leaving the Flight Park LZ on the way to launch pick up a Trail Map of where you'll be hiking. Follow the trail at all times. The best approach is to follow those who know the route. Once you have hiked the trail and taken the correct turns (basically one or two) it will be easy. In the evening it is important to leave early enough to have sunlight to see by and find your way back to the parking area at the trailhead. Carry a flashlight.
We suggest the basics: plenty of water, sunscreen, hat, wind breaker or an extra layer
When hiking back from the launch go with those who know the way. If you're alone, use the Trail Map. Again it is an easy trail to follow. However, if you do get lost, call your friends or the LZ phone number for assistance. Stay calm and collected. You will be helped. If you did not contact anyone (very unlikely) call the Park Police phone number. Do not call 911, unless it is an emergency, Use your common sense and discernment please.
Here are the phone numbers, advisable for safety reasons, to enter into your cell phones:
Flight Park LZ phone number is: 518-697-0718
Park Police number is: 845-889-8866
Park Ranger number is: 518-329-3993

Thank you for reading through these instructions and suggestions. Much of our activity is about reducing risks and making safety our highest priority. Not just for pilots, but for all our visiting guests as well. Enjoy your visit and please be safe while on the mountain!
